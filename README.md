# uber_Ridesharing_clustering
Hi !!!
in this repository i have use sk learn kmeans clustering in a unsupervised manner on uber rides data of april 2014 in new york .
KMEANS is a machine learning algorithm in which it cluster a data in no groups based on similairties between the differenet element of the dataset .
i have shown at which location uber should placed its cab in highly demand morning and evening slot to minimise the pick -up time .
and also predict which nearby cab should go to pick up the customer .
for to mark points i have used folium .
lib used sk learn , pandas , seaborn ,folium  , seaborn .
